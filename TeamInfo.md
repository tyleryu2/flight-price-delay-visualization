## Project Summary

People donâ€™t want to encounter delays when taking a flight. The stress of spending a night at an airport due to weather or general airport delays is a harrowing experience, especially for people traveling with children. Our solution estimates the delays you would encounter at any airport in the USA, with a specific airline, or on a specific route around the country, while providing visualization of the requested information.
